Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.ata structure is needed to store multiple values(or multiple types of values)in the same object.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A. There are many operations we can perform on Data Structure like;
 Create, update,add, remove, insert, replace, merge, delete...

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. Most areas in which Data Structure is applied are:
 Data bases ,Data Science,Operating Systems, Machine Learning...

what is an Array?
A. An array a non-primitive variable that can hold multiple values inside.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A.Array is static(bonded,can not hold multiple data types) ,ArrayList is dynamic.

what is LinkedList?
A. It is a list that uses nodes to store values.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
A. Array stores values in memory(inside blocks) ,linkedList stores values in nodes (easier to manipulate).

what is queue?
A. It is a collection based on the way that the data is stored inside(first in first out).

what is stack?
A.It is a collection based on the way that the data is stored inside(last in first out).

what is FIFO and LIFO?
A.  FIFO: Fist In First Out.

what is the order of complexity?
A. Storing the value from the smallest to the biggest.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A. The map.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A.Collection.

what is tree in data structure?
A. It is a Non-linear hierarchical data structure defined as a collection of nodes. (child and parent).

what is graph in data structure?
A. a non-linear data made of nodes that may have multiples ways to go from point A to B.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A. HashTable is synchronised and HashMap is not synchronised.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
A. RDBMS = Array (i.e. Array of structures)
   Network data model = Graph
   Hierarchical data model = Trees
How HashMap works in java?
A. Key-value pair.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
A. it is an ERROR thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A. array.copy()
   System.arraycopy()
   object.clone()

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A. Array store values in memory ,linkedList store values in nodes (easier to manipulate).

What is DFS and BFS?
A.  DFS stands for Depth First Search and BFS stands for Breadth First Search.

What is Recursion?
A. Recursion is when a method calls itself.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A. a.Linear => Array, stack, Queue, LinkedList.(data is stored)
   b.Non-Linear => Graph, Tree .(nodes can be linked to any other node).

What is Big-(O)-notation?
A.  A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards
   a particular value or infinity.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
A. insertion sort, selection sort, bubble sort, bucket sort, merge sort, heap sort.

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
